# Requirement

Build a Node.js REST API for a basic "note-taking" application with a single "Note" entity. A note will have title (string), description (string), createdDate (Date), and isArchived (boolean) fields.

The application should be able to perform the following tasks:

Create a new note.
Fetch all notes.
Update an existing note by its ID.
Delete a note by its ID.
Archive/unarchive a note.
Fetch all archived notes.
Also, create a simple React application to consume this API, which should have forms and views to perform these operations.

The data should be stored in MongoDB.

# How to run the project

## Server side
npm install
npm run start

## Client side
npm install
npm run start

You should run the mongodb first to connect mongodb.
